--- Part Two ---

As you finish the last group's customs declaration, you notice that you misread one word in the instructions:

You don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered "yes"; you need to identify the questions to which everyone answered "yes"!

Using the same example as above:

abc

a
b
c

ab
ac

a
a
a
a

b

This list represents answers from five groups:

- In the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
- In the second group, there is no question to which everyone answered "yes".
- In the third group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a. Since some people did not answer "yes" to b or c, they don't count.
- In the fourth group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a.
- In the fifth group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 1 question, b.
- In this example, the sum of these counts is 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

For each group, count the number of questions to which everyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?
