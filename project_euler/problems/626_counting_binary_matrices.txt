Counting Binary Matrices

A binary matrix is a matrix consisting entirely of 0s and 1s. Consider the following transformations that can be performed on a binary matrix:

Swap any two rows
Swap any two columns
Flip all elements in a single row (1s become 0s, 0s become 1s)
Flip all elements in a single column
Two binary matrices $A$ and $B$ will be considered equivalent if there is a sequence of such transformations that when applied to $A$ yields $B$. For example, the following two matrices are equivalent:
$A=\begin{pmatrix} 
  1 & 0 & 1 \\ 
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} \quad B=\begin{pmatrix} 
  0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}$
via the sequence of two transformations "Flip all elements in column 3" followed by "Swap rows 1 and 2".

Define $c(n)$ to be the maximum number of $n\times n$ binary matrices that can be found such that no two are equivalent. For example, $c(3)=3$. You are also given that $c(5)=39$ and $c(8)=656108$.

Find $c(20)$, and give your answer modulo $1\,001\,001\,011$.
