Goldbach's other conjecture

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
9 = 7 + 2 x 12
15 = 7 + 2 x 22
21 = 3 + 2 x 32
25 = 7 + 2 x 32
27 = 19 + 2 x 22
33 = 31 + 2 x 12
It turns out that the conjecture was false.
What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
