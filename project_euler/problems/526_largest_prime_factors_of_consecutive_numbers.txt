Largest prime factors of consecutive numbers

Let f(n) be the largest prime factor of n.
Let g(n) = f(n) + f(n+1) + f(n+2) + f(n+3) + f(n+4) + f(n+5) + f(n+6) + f(n+7) + f(n+8), the sum of the largest prime factor of each of nine consecutive numbers starting with n.
Let h(n) be the maximum value of g(k) for 2 ≤ k ≤ n.
You are given:
f(100) = 5
f(101) = 101
g(100) = 409
h(100) = 417
h(109) = 4896292593Find h(1016).
